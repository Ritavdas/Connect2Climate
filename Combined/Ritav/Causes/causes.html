              Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the
              mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse
              effect"1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat
              radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere
              block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain
              semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically
              or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing"
              climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond
              physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as
              "feedbacks." Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect

                  <b>Water vapor: </b>The most abundant greenhouse gas, but
                  importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor
                  increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the
                  possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of
                  the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse
                  effect.

                  <b>Carbon dioxide (CO2): </b>A minor but very important
                  component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released
                  through natural processes such as respiration and volcano
                  eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation,
                  land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have
                  increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the
                  Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important
                  long-lived "forcing" of climate change.

                <li>
                  <b> Methane: </b>A hydrocarbon gas produced both through
                  natural sources and human activities, including the
                  decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and
                  especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and
                  manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a
                  molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active
                  greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much
                  less abundant in the atmosphere.

                  and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid
                  production, and biomass burning.

                  applications, but now largely regulated in production and
                  release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their
                  ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They

                  On Earth, human activities are changing the natural
                  greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels
                  like coal and oil has increased the concentration of
                  atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the
                  coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the
                  air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for
                  agriculture, industry, and other human activities has
                  increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The consequences
                  of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult
                  to predict, but some effects seem likely:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may
                    welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and
                    precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary,
                    some becoming wetter and others dryer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the ocean and
                    partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, increasing sea
                    level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms,
                    contributing further to sea level rise.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Outside of a greenhouse, higher atmospheric carbon dioxide
                    (CO2) levels can have both positive and negative effects on
                    crop yields. Some laboratory experiments suggest that
                    elevated CO2 levels can increase plant growth.

              Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme

              of agricultural producers and the food security of communities
              worldwide. Depending on the crop and ecosystem, weeds, pests, and
              fungi can also thrive under warmer temperatures, wetter climates,
              and increased CO2 levels, and climate change will likely increase
              weeds and pests. Finally, although rising CO2 can stimulate plant
              growth, research has shown that it can also reduce the nutritional
              value of most food crops by reducing the concentrations of protein
              and essential minerals in most plant species. Climate change can

                      Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About
                      half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through
                      the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed
                      and then radiated upward in the form of infrared heat.
                      About 90 percent of this heat is then absorbed by the
                      greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface.

                      How do we know that changes in the Sun aren’t to blame for
                      current global warming trends? Since 1978, a series of
                      satellite instruments have measured the energy output of
                      the Sun directly. The satellite data show a very slight
                      drop in solar irradiance (which is a measure of the amount
                      of energy the Sun gives off) over this time period. So the
                      Sun doesn't appear to be responsible for the warming trend
                      observed over the past several decades. Longer-term
                      estimates of solar irradiance have been made using sunspot
                      records and other so-called “proxy indicators,” such as
                      the amount of carbon in tree rings. The most recent
                      analyses of these proxies indicate that solar irradiance
                      changes cannot plausibly account for more than 10 percent
                      of the 20th century’s warming.
