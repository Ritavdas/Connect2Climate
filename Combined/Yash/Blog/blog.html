          <h2 id="First_Point_Header">Average Temperature</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.5°F over the past
            century, and is projected to rise another 0.5 to 8.6°F over the next
            hundred years. Small changes in the average temperature of the
            planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in
            climate and weather.<br />
            Geologists and paleontologists have found that, in the last 100
            million years, global temperatures have peaked twice. One spike was
            the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse roughly 92 million years ago, about 25
            million years before Earth’s last dinosaurs went extinct. Widespread
            volcanic activity may have boosted atmospheric carbon dioxide.
            Temperatures were so high that champsosaurs (crocodile-like
            reptiles) lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic, and
            warm-temperature forests thrived near the South Pole.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Second_Point_Header">Climate</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            Climate is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long
            period. The standard averaging period is 30 years, but other periods
            may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes
            statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of
            day-to-day or year-to-year variations.<br />
            Climate change is any systematic change in the long-term statistics
            of climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, pressure,
            or wind sustained over several decades or longer. Climate change can
            be due to natural external forcings (changes in solar emission or
            changes in the earth’s orbit, natural internal processes of the
            climate system) or it can be human induced.
          </p>

            World Meteorological Organization(WMO)
          </h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) describes "climate
            normals" (CN) as "reference points used by climatologists to compare
            current climatological trends to that of the past or what is
            considered typical. A CN is defined as the arithmetic average of a
            climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. A 30 year
            period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual
            variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show
            longer climatic trends.<br />
            It originated from the International Meteorological Organization
            (IMO), the roots of which were planted at the 1873 Vienna
            International Meteorological Congress. Established by the
            ratification of the WMO Convention on 23 March 1950, WMO became the
            specialised agency of the United Nations for meteorology (weather
            and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences
            a year later. The Secretariat, headquartered in Geneva, is headed by
            the Secretary-General. Its supreme body is the World Meteorological
            Congress.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Fourth_Point_Header">Classification Of Climate</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            The Köppen climate classification is one of the most widely used
            climate classification systems. It was first published by
            German-Russian climatologist Wladimir Köppen (1846–1940) in
            1884,with several later modifications by Köppen, notably in 1918 and
            1936. Later, the climatologist Rudolf Geiger (1894-1981) introduced
            some changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes
            called the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system.<br />
            The Köppen climate classification divides climates into five main
            climate groups, with each group being divided based on seasonal
            precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are A
            (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar).
            Each group and subgroup is represented by a letter. All climates are
            assigned a main group (the first letter). All climates except for
            those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation subgroup
            (the second letter). For example, Af indicates a tropical rainforest
            climate. The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups
            other than those in the A group, indicated by the third letter for
            climates in B, C, and D, and the second letter for climates in E.
            For example, Cfb indicates an oceanic climate with warm summers as
            indicated by the ending b. Climates are classified based on specific
            criteria unique to each climate type
          </p>
          <h2 id="Fifth_Point_Header">Cyclone Amphan-West Bengal</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            This year in India, West Bengal experienced devastating floods on
            the account of Cyclone Amphan; northern India reeled under a cold
            wave and North East under heavy spells of rain; and locusts spelled
            doom for crops in north India. The storm in West Bengal used massive
            damage to standing crops, thousands of trees were uprooted, and
            power and water supply was interrupted in the state capital Kolkata.
            Many in the state have lost their entire homes as well. Cyclone
            Amphan made its landfall in West Bengal between Digha and Hatiya on
            the afternoon of May 20, as a very severe cyclonic storm with
            sustained wind speeds of 155-165 kilometres per hour spiralling up
            to 185 kilometres per hour.<br />
            The coastal state of Odisha and the neighbouring country of
            Bangladesh were also impacted by the cyclone. River embankments have
            been breached in South and North 24 Parganas districts in West
            Bengal, leaving several houses inundated as water through the
            breaches slipped into remote settlements, mostly in the Sundarbans.
            <br />
            And there was more — in addition to the novel coronavirus disease
            (COVID-19) pandemic that only made rescue and rehabilitation process
            challenging.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Sixth_Point_Header">Global Temperature</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will
            continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse
            gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on
            Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists
            from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature
            rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. The
            lockdowns and reduced societal activity related to the COVID-19
            pandemic affected emissions of pollutants in ways that slightly
            warmed the planet for several months last year, according to new
            research led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research
            (NCAR).<br />

            According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on
            individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of
            different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to
            change.The new study highlights the complex and often conflicting
            influences of different types of emissions from power plants, motor
            vehicles, industrial facilities, and other sources.<br />
          </p>
          <h2 id="Seventh_Point_Header">Greenhouse</h2>
          <p style="color: white">
            Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival
            of humans and millions of other living things, by keeping some of
            the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space and making Earth
            livable. But after more than a century and a half of
            industrialization, deforestation, and large scale agriculture,
            quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen to
            record levels not seen in three million years. As populations,
            economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level
            of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.There are several greenhouse
            gases and they are listed below:-<br />
          </p>

          <div class="a">
            <h3 id="Seventh_Sub_Point_1">Carbon Dioxide</h3>
            <p style="color: white">
              Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels
              (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees and other
              biological materials, and also as a result of certain chemical
              reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is removed
              from the atmosphere (or "sequestered") when it is absorbed by
              plants as part of the biological carbon cycle.
            </p>
            <h3 id="Seventh_Sub_Point_2">Methane</h3>
            <p style="color: white">
              Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal,
              natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from livestock
              and other agricultural practices and by the decay of organic waste

            <p style="color: white">
              Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial
              activities, combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste, as well as
              during treatment of wastewater.

            <h3 id="Seventh_Sub_Point_4">Fluorinated Gases</h3>
            <p style="color: white">
              Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and
              nitrogen trifluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that
              are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated
              gases are sometimes used as substitutes for stratospheric
              ozone-depleting substances (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons,
              hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and halons). These gases are typically
              emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent
              greenhouse gases, they are sometimes referred to as High Global
              Warming Potential gases ("High GWP gases").
