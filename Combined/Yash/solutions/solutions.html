    <h1>Solutions For Climate Changes</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p style="color: white">
        Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes (such
        as oceanic circulation), biotic processes (e.g., plants), variations in
        solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic
        eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural world. The
        latter effect is currently causing global warming, and "climate change"
        is often used to describe human-specific impacts.

          <p style="color: white">
            The first challenge is eliminating the burning of coal, oil and,
            eventually, natural gas. This is perhaps the most daunting challenge
            as denizens of richer nations literally eat, wear, work, play and
            even sleep on the products made from such fossilized sunshine. And
            citizens of developing nations want and arguably deserve the same
            comforts, which are largely thanks to the energy stored in such
            fuels.<br />
            Oil is the lubricant of the global economy, hidden inside such
            ubiquitous items as plastic and corn, and fundamental to the
            transportation of both consumers and goods. Coal is the substrate,
            supplying roughly half of the electricity used in the U.S. and
            nearly that much worldwide—a percentage that is likely to grow,
            according to the International Energy Agency. There are no perfect
            solutions for reducing dependence on fossil fuels (for example,
            carbon neutral biofuels can drive up the price of food and lead to
            forest destruction, and while nuclear power does not emit greenhouse
            gases, it does produce radioactive waste), but every bit counts.<br />
            So try to employ alternatives when possible—plant-derived plastics,
            biodiesel, wind power—and to invest in the change, be it by
            divesting from oil stocks or investing in companies practicing
            carbon capture and storage.

            Buildings worldwide contribute around one third of all greenhouse
            gas emissions (43 percent in the U.S. alone), even though investing
            in thicker insulation and other cost-effective,
            temperature-regulating steps can save money in the long run.
            Electric grids are at capacity or overloaded, but power demands
            continue to rise. And bad roads can lower the fuel economy of even
            the most efficient vehicle. Investing in new infrastructure, or
            radically upgrading existing highways and transmission lines, would
            help cut greenhouse gas emissions and drive economic growth in
            developing countries.<br />
            Of course, it takes a lot of cement, a major source of greenhouse
            gas emissions, to construct new buildings and roads. The U.S. alone
            contributed 50.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the
            atmosphere in 2005 from cement production, which requires heating
            limestone and other ingredients to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,642
            degrees Fahrenheit). Mining copper and other elements needed for
            electrical wiring and transmission also causes globe-warming
            pollution.<br />
            But energy-efficient buildings and improved cement-making processes
            (such as using alternative fuels to fire up the kiln) could reduce
            greenhouse gas emissions in the developed world and prevent them in
            the developing world.

            Every year, 33 million acres of forests are cut down. Timber
            harvesting in the tropics alone contributes 1.5 billion metric tons
            of carbon to the atmosphere. That represents 20 percent of
            human-made greenhouse gas emissions and a source that could be
            avoided relatively easily.<br />
            Improved agricultural practices along with paper recycling and
            forest management—balancing the amount of wood taken out with the
            amount of new trees growing—could quickly eliminate this significant
            chunk of emissions.<br />
            And when purchasing wood products, such as furniture or flooring,
            buy used goods or, failing that, wood certified to have been
            sustainably harvested. The Amazon and other forests are not just the
            lungs of the earth, they may also be humanity's best short-term hope
            for limiting climate change.<br />

            Replacing fossil fuels may prove the great challenge of the 21st
            century. Many contenders exist, ranging from ethanol derived from
            crops to hydrogen electrolyzed out of water, but all of them have
            some drawbacks, too, and none are immediately available at the scale
            needed.<br />
            Biofuels can have a host of negative impacts, from driving up food
            prices to sucking up more energy than they produce. Hydrogen must be
            created, requiring either reforming natural gas or electricity to
            crack water molecules. Biodiesel hybrid electric vehicles (that can
            plug into the grid overnight) may offer the best transportation
            solution in the short term, given the energy density of diesel and
            the carbon neutral ramifications of fuel from plants as well as the
            emissions of electric engines. A recent study found that the present
            amount of electricity generation in the U.S. could provide enough
            energy for the country's entire fleet of automobiles to switch to
            plug-in hybrids, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the
            process.<br />
            But plug-in hybrids would still rely on electricity, now
            predominantly generated by burning dirty coal. Massive investment in
            low-emission energy generation, whether solar-thermal power or
            nuclear fission, would be required to radically reduce greenhouse
            gas emissions. And even more speculative energy
            sources—hyperefficient photovoltaic cells, solar energy stations in
            orbit or even fusion—may ultimately be required.<br />

            Corn grown in the U.S. requires barrels of oil for the fertilizer to
            grow it and the diesel fuel to harvest and transport it. Some
            grocery stores stock organic produce that do not require such
            fertilizers, but it is often shipped from halfway across the globe.
            And meat, whether beef, chicken or pork, requires pounds of feed to
            produce a pound of protein.<br />
            Choosing food items that balance nutrition, taste and ecological
            impact is no easy task. Foodstuffs often bear some nutritional
            information, but there is little to reveal how far a head of
            lettuce, for example, has traveled.<br />
            University of Chicago researchers estimate that each meat-eating
            American produces 1.5 tons more greenhouse gases through their food
            choice than do their vegetarian peers. It would also take far less
            land to grow the crops necessary to feed humans than livestock,
            allowing more room for planting trees.<br /><br />
